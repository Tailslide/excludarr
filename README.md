# Excludarr
Excludarr is a CLI that interacts with Radarr and Sonarr instances. It completely manages you library in Sonarr and Radarr to only consist out of movies and series that are not present on any of the configured streaming providers. Excludarr can also re monitor movies and series if it is not available anymore on any of the configured streaming providers. You can also configure to delete the already downloaded files of the excluded entry to keep your storage happy! ðŸŽ‰

## Installation
Installation of excludarr can be done using pip.

```bash
pip install excludarr
```

## Configuration
To configure the application make sure that one of the following files exists:

```bash
/etc/excludarr/excludarr.yml
~/.config/excludarr/excludarr.yml
~/.excludarr/config/excludarr.yml
~/.excludarr.yml
./.excludarr.yml
```

The application will read those configuration files in that order. So `./.excludarr.yml` will overwrite `/etc/excludarr/excludarr.yml`. For a full list of options and their description see [.excludarr-example.yml](https://github.com/haijeploeg/excludarr/blob/main/.excludarr-example.yml) in this repository.

> NOTE: To get a full list of available providers in your country, execute `excludarr providers list` and copy the full name of the provider in your configuration.

## Radarr
The `radarr` subcommands manages the library in your configured Radarr instance. Check `excludarr radarr --help` for a full list of options.

### Exclude
To delete or disable monitoring of the movies in Radarr you can execute the `excludarr radarr exclude` command. You can determine to either delete the movie or change the status to not monitored. You can alo configure if you want to delete the associated files and to add an import exclusion to prevent future importing of the movie.

By default no files are being deleted, you have to set the `-d` flag. To make the command non-interactive you can pass the `-y` flag to auto accept the confirmation question. To show the progress of the process you can pass the `--progress` flag to get a nice progress bar! Read the help page of the command carefully to adjust the command to your needs.

```bash
$ excludarr radarr exclude -a delete -d -e

Are you sure you want to delete the listed movies? [y/n] (n): y
Succesfully deleted the movies from Radarr!
```

> NOTE: If you want to exclude any of the movies listed in the table, just copy the title and paste it in your configuration file under `radarr -> excludes`.

### Re-add
To re enable monitoring of not-monitored movies in Radarr that are not present anymore on any of the streaming providers, you can execute `excludarr radarr re-add`. This will lookup all movies that are not monitored anymore in Radarr and check if they are still available on the configured streaming providers. If there is no match, the status of the movie will change to monitored. This is handy if you remove a streaming provider from the configuration, or if the movie is being deleted from a streaming provider.

```bash
$ excludarr radarr re-add
